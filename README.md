This is the last project done in the course of AI programming at Udacity

The project uses **Pytorch** to implement **transfer learning** to take advantage of pre-trained densenet161 model to do **flower classification**, where there are 102 classes of flowers in dataset

Here is the project file [Flower_Classifier-zh.ipynb](Flower_Classifier-zh.ipynb)
