This is the last project for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program

The project uses **Pytorch** to implement **transfer learning** to take advantage of pre-trained densenet161 model to do **flower classification**, where there are 102 classes of flowers in dataset

Here is the project file [Flower_Classifier-zh.ipynb](Flower_Classifier-zh.ipynb)  
Note:  you may use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to quickly load .ipynb file


Here is the Certificate for the Course Completion.
